# Banking Application in C++ with Qt/QML

This is a beginner-level banking application built in **C++** using **Qt/QML** for the graphical user interface.

The project is being developed in two stages:  
1. **Terminal-based version (in progress):** All core logic and features are being developed first through the console.  
2. **Graphical Interface (coming soon):** In the following weeks, we’ll integrate a fluid and dynamic user interface using Qt and QML.

It includes essential banking features such as user identity verification during login, account creation, and inter-account transactions.  
An administrator interface is also available for managing all user accounts and transactions.

This project does **not use a real database**. Instead, it relies on C++ sequential and associative containers to store data in memory — making it perfect for beginners learning both logic and basic data management.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **C++** – Backend logic  
- **Qt & QML** – User interface (upcoming)  
- **STL containers** – For in-memory data storage

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Beni1707/My-First-C-Bank-Application-.git

# Pull the latest changes (optional if clone is fresh)
git pull origin main
```
⚠️ Limitations
No persistent data storage (all data is lost when the program exits)

No encryption or security layer (not suitable for production)

🎯 Purpose
This project is designed for learners passionate about C++ who want to:

Practice core logic development

Understand basic banking operations

Transition from console-based apps to dynamic GUI design using Qt and QML

Gain experience in managing data without jumping directly into complex databases
