# Banking Application in C++ with Qt/QML

This is a beginner-level banking application developed in C++ using Qt and QML for the graphical interface. It includes essential features such as user identity verification at login, account creation, and inter-account transactions. 

An administrator interface allows management of all created accounts and transactions. 

The project does not use a real database, instead relying on C++ sequential and associative containers to store data in memory, making it suitable for beginners in database management.

## Features
- User login with identity verification
- Account creation
- Money transfers between accounts
- Administrator view of all accounts and transactions

## Technologies
- C++ (backend logic)
- Qt and QML (UI)
- Standard Template Library containers for data management

## Limitations
- No persistent data storage (all data lost on exit)
- No encryption or advanced security measures

## Purpose
Designed for learners passionate about C++ who want to practice GUI development and basic banking operations without complex database integration.
